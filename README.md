## Based on the analysis of over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns, I have found that several trends have emerged. When broken down by the specifc subcatergory of "Theater" I have found that the most successful theater campaigns were launched in the month of May with a steady decrease in success rate to September. I recommend to ensure success of your project you launch your Kickstarter in the month of May.
